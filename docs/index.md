Discover the **KISS AI Stack**—a thoughtfully engineered framework designed to enable **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** solutions. This stack allows you to seamlessly combine multiple LLMs, each optimized for specific tasks, into a unified system. With its clean, no-boilerplate approach, it frees developers from repetitive code and lets them focus on building RAG-powered applications.



## Why the Name "KISS AI Stack"?

The name is inspired by the timeless principle, **"Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS)**. True to its name, this stack emphasizes simplicity and efficiency. No unnecessary complexities, just powerful tools to create RAG solutions with minimal overhead. Perfect for developers who value clarity and speed.



## Main Components

Below is a visualization of how the key components of the **KISS AI Stack** come together to form a cohesive system:

### KISS AI Stack Core

The **Core** is the heart of the stack, offering essential tools for RAG-driven development:  
- **AI/LLM Clients**: Interface with leading Large Language Models.  
- **Vector Database Clients**: Handle embeddings and retrieval seamlessly.  
- **Prompt & RAG Tools**: Simplify Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows with a "no more, no less" philosophy.  
- **Autonomous Decision Maker**: Build adaptable workflows capable of informed, independent actions.  

*Bonus*: You can use the Core as a standalone library for building lightweight RAG solutions, with no dependency on the server stub or SDK.



### KISS AI Stack Server

The **Server** provides a robust backend layer, offering:  
- **Abstracted RAG APIs**: RESTful or WebSocket-based for seamless integration.  
- **Lifecycle Event Handling**: Manage RAG application states with ease.  
- **Session-based Instances**: Dedicated sessions with isolated document stores(tenant based + collection based) and state management.

With these features, you can focus on functionality without worrying about backend complexity.



### KISS AI Stack Client SDK

The **Client SDK** bridges the gap between your application and the server. It includes:  
- Ready-to-use functions for server communication.  
- Tools to interact with RAG solutions.  

If you’re looking for the quickest way to leverage the power of the KISS AI Stack, the SDK is your go-to solution.



Let’s keep it simple, powerful, and fun. Dive in and start building RAG-powered software!
