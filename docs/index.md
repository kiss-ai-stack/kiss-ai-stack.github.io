### Why "KISS AI Stack"?
The name comes from the principle **"Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS)**. The stack is all about simplicity without cutting corners, letting you work on AI assisted solutions with minimal effort.
<br><br>

#### Best for:

- **Chatbots**: Quickly create interactive agents for conversations.
- **Query Systems**: Handle user queries, whether based on data or text prompts.
- **Sensitive Data and In-House Solutions**: Easily set up private AI systems for secure, domain-specific tasks (like RAG).
<br><br>

#### Key Features:

- **Dynamic Tools**: RAG and prompt tools are created as needed, so the agent can handle whatever comes its way.
- **Simple Setup**: Define your agentâ€™s behavior in a YAML file, without writing a lot of code.
- **Easy Integration**: Connect seamlessly with other parts of the KISS AI Stack for a complete solution.
